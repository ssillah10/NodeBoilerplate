I made this script to automate the process of creating a boilerplate for a basic CRUD app using Node, Express, Mongoose etc. It will create the basic directories and files needed to get you started. It will also create a basic data schema/model mimmicing a blogpost/application. Feel free to edit to suit your needs. It will also create basic restful CRUD routes in the app.js file. Please go through the app.js file and edit as needed. 

To run the script using Node, simply run $ node boilerplate MainFolderName .

If no folder name was provided, it will default to Project.
